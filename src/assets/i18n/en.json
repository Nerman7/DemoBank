Unlike standard keyboard this one has shuffled numbers which is security measure used to prevent eavesdropping while you type your PIN. Also, instead of seeing the numbers you type you'll just see X signs as feedback for received input but actual numbers won't be shown for security reasons.\n\nWhen you set your PIN, you have to retype it in order to avoid errors and to be sure you correctly typed it in the first place. Don't write down your PIN, be sure to remember it and keep it secret. In case you forget PIN, you'll have to go through recovery procedure which will enable you to use the application again.\n\nOnce you correctly retype your PIN, the keyboard will close and NEXT button will be enabled to allow you to finalize the registration. For future access to the application you'll just need to input PIN to application login screen.\n\nIn addition, if you have mobile device with biometric features (e.g. TouchID or FaceID), you can enable their usage by ticking appropriate checkbox provided below PIN input fields. In that case your login will be even simpler – you'll just need to present your fingerprint or face to your mobile device when accessing the application.",

Such keyboard prevents eavesdropping when entering PIN for increased security. When typing numbers, as feedback you'll only see X signs instead of numbers for security reasons.\n\nSince minimum PIN length is 4 digits, button NEXT will be disabled as long as there's less than 4 numbers in input field. If your PIN is 8 digits long, keyboard will be closed once you enter 8 numbers. If your PIN is less than 8 digits, you can close keyboard by tapping down arrow or stop typing and keyboard will close after 3 seconds of inactivity.\n\nTapping to next button start login process by using PIN to unlock the key stored within your application's vault and sending signed ticket to your digital bank. Correct PIN will result with correct signature and your access will be granted.\n\nIf you enter incorrect PIN, your signature won't be correct, access won't be granted and you'll get error info. If you enter wrong PIN 3 times consecutively your application will be locked and you'll have to perform recovery procedure. If you enter correct PIN after one or two wrong tries, the counter of wrong attempts will be reset.\n\nIn case you enabled one of biometric features, it prevails PIN login and you'll first be required to present your fingerprint or face to mobile device. In case of failure (unrecognized fingerprint or face), PIN input field be activated and you can enter PIN as fallback login mechanism.\n\nOnce you are positively identified and the access to digital bank is granted, your session starts and you won't be required to enter PIN again as long as this session lasts. However, for security reasons you may be required to enter PIN when executing certain financial transactions. Additionally, if you exceed defined period of inactivity (usually 1 min) or leave the application unattended for same period (regardless in foreground or background), the application will automatically logoff and you’ll be required to enter PIN or execute biometrics login if you want to continue using application within same session. Alternatively, the application will log you off from digital bank when you close it.\n\nYou can always change your PIN within settings section once you successfully login to the application.

It can’t be e.g. 168 (too short), 5555 (same characters) or 1234 (simple sequence).\n\n Tapping to input field will invoke numeric keyboard. Unlike standard keyboard this one has shuffled numbers which is security measure used to prevent eavesdropping while you type your PIN. Also, instead of seeing the numbers you type you’ll just see X signs as feedback for received input but actual numbers won’t be shown for security reasons.\n\n When you define your new PIN, you have to retype it in order to avoid errors and to be sure you correctly typed it in the first place. Don’t write down your PIN, be sure to remember it and keep it secret. In case you forget PIN, you’ll have to go through recovery procedure which will enable you to use the application again.",
